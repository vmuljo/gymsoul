        <h4>Topic and Purpose:</h4>
        <p>
          My website is a workout logger website, branded as Gym Soul, that can
          allow users to log their workouts by choosing some preset workouts (or
          other custom), save the workouts, and see their weekly summary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intended audience for this website is anyone who goes to or wants
          to go to the gym to get a workout in and wants to keep track of what
          they do over the course of the workout
        </p>
        <p>
          Gym Soul's purpose is to give users a way to organize their workouts
          and also keep track of how their mental health progresses over time
          (to be implemented in future versions).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>
          My site works by using user credentials to log in, which the user can
          create an account or, for testing purposes, access the premade user
          account for Tommy Trojan (username: ttrojan@usc.edu, password: itp304)
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon login, users are met with the home screen, which lets users view
          their last 5 logged workouts and allow them to log a new workout.
          Clicking "Log a new workout" opens up a modal form that users can
          input information of their workout into. Users are given the freedom
          of inputting custom information into time of workout, reps, and
          weight, so they are not restricted to numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can access the Workouts page through the sidebar. On this page,
          they can view all the workouts they have logged and filter the
          workouts by searching for the name of workout. The workouts are
          displayed in card form to show basic information, but upon click of a
          card, an information modal opens up to display the workout more in
          depth, showing each exercise performed along with sets performed.
          Users also have the option of deleting the workout or updating the
          basic information (title, length, and date of workout) when they click
          on the modal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sign out, users can simply click the signout button on the bottom
          of the sidebar.
        </p>

        <h4>Sources</h4>
        <p>
          The source of my data largely comes from me and my knowledge with the
          gym, so I inputted some of the most popular exercises into the
          exercises table that users can choose from. However, users may also
          add a custom workout through text input if not in dropdown box. The
          rest of my data comes from user input, through creating an account or
          creating new workouts.

            Frontend/Backend AJAX
            <ul>
              <li>
                Most of my project uses AJAX calls to communicate with the
                backend and receive information from it to keep the website at
                single page processing and not redirecting to other pages upon
                submit
              </li>
              <li>
                This includes getting workouts, adding workouts, getting
                exercises, deleting workouts, refreshing exercises, and
                searching for workouts.

            SQL Aggregate Functions
            <ul>
              <li>
                One SQL Aggregate function was used, which was used in the
                Workouts page when displaying the total count of exercises for
                each workout on a card.
              </li>

            Many to many table relationship
            <ul>
              <li>
                One many to many table relationship is used here, between the
                workouts and exercises. This table holds the workout id and
                exercise id, as many workouts has many exercises, so we use this
                joining table to connect the data from workouts and data from
                exercises.
              </li>

            Sessions
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sessions is used when a user logs in, which then we store if the
                user is logged in so they remain logged in on page refresh and
                so we maintain the user id of the user, which we use to fetch
                workouts.

            Permissions for only one level: registered users
            <ul>
              <li>
                I only implement one level of permissions for this website,
                which is for registered users so they can add workouts, delete
                workouts, update workout information, and read their workout
                information. I do not implement any admin or global level
                permission levels.

        <h4>Frameworks/Templates</h4>
        <p>
          This project uses the Bootstrap 5.0 template all over the projects
          website to help with templating and displaying the style. I also use
          the modals from Bootstrap to help with templating the modal and having
          it display modally.
