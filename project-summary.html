        <h4>Topic and Purpose: </h4>
        <p>My website is a workout logger website, branded as Gym Soul, that can allow users to log their workouts by choosing some preset workouts (or other custom), save the workouts, and see their weekly summary.</p>
        <p>The intended audience for this website is anyone who goes to or wants to go to the gym to get a workout in and wants to keep track of what they do over the course of the workout</p>
        <p>Gym Soul's purpose is to give users a way to organize their workouts and also keep track of how their mental health progresses over time (to be implemented in future versions).</p>
