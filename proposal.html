    <h1>Workout Logger Proposal</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Topic: </h4>
        <p>My website is a workout logger website that can allow users to log their workouts by choosing some preset workouts (or other custom), save the workouts, and see their weekly summary.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Audience</h4>
        <p>The intended audience for this website is anyone who goes to or wants to go to the gym to get a workout in and wants to keep track of what they do over the course of the workout</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Design and Style:</h4>
        <p>The design of this website will be fairly simple. I will utilize dropdown boxes to select a workout and an optional input field if an "Other" workout was selected. Modals will be used for users to add or edit workouts. Pages will be selected from the navigation bar.
            In the modal, the user can then add how many reps and sets they did and with a checkbox to ask if the workout went to failure or not. 
            As for styling, I want to keep the style simple and minimal to minimize clutter. The theme will be dark mode, with a dark background (#3B4352), white text (#F2F3F7), and orange accents (#F05E31) (Accent color subject to change).

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>I'm planning on having 4 pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Login Page</li>
            <li>Home Page</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Modal popup page to add or edit workouts</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Workouts page</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Modal popup page to add or edit workouts</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Settings Page</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Database</h4>
        <p>Data Stored in Database:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User Login Information</li>
            <li>User workouts</li>
            <li>Types of exercises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The source of my data, specifically for types of exercises, will come from various workout websites that list types of exercises as well as
            coming from my own experience from working out. The sources for the other databases, such as user login info and user workouts, will come from user input.
